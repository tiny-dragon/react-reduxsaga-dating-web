        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>CAN I CHANGE MY USERNAME OR OTHER PROFILE INFORMATION?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            The EDIT PROFILE area under ACCOUNT is where you can add a photo, and update your profile.
            To update or correct profile information, simply type over the existing information, or use the page to change your answers.
            Then click on the SAVE button to make those changes permanent. You must click the SAVE button on each page you are updating.
          </p>
          <p>** We do not recommend changing usernames often since that is how other members will come to know you by.</p>
          <li>
            <h4>HOW DO I GET MY PHOTO INTO MY PROFILE?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            Photos are the best way to show off that great smile and it will increase your responses ten-fold. It is easy,
            just use the Add/Delete Photos link on the ACCOUNT page. Then use the CHOOSE or BROWSE button to search your computer for the photo file you want to use.
            This requires you already have a photo on your computer or other device. If you don't have a scanner or a picture of yourself on your computer, we suggest
            having a friend with a scanner do this for you, or you can consider going to a printer. They will be able to scan your photo onto a CD for you. (Ask them to
            save the photo in a computer format called a JPEG with a maximum file size of 2MB. NOTE: Any photos deemed inappropriate will be removed; photos of children
            or childhood photos are not allowed for your first photo and the initial photo should be clear and preferrably a headshot.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>HOW CAN I CHANGE MY AGE?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            Since accounts are non-transferrable you must email us your month/day/year of birth along with your username.
            All new members are asked this question when they join, and our system automatically updates your age each year.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>HOW DO I CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            Just login to the site, and go to the ACCOUNT link to bring up options to change your Account including the Cancel option.
            If you do cancel, you can reactivate anytime however your present renewal date will not change if/when you reactivate.
          </p>
          <p>
            REMEMBER: CatholicSingles.com registers thousands of new members each month. It's simply counterproductive not to take full advantage of the
            time you have paid for, so we urge you to remain a member for as long as possible, since you never know when the person for you will signup!
            Of course when you are ready to cancel, just login and go to the Account area, click on the CANCEL button that appears and follow the directions
            to close your membership. When you come back to our site and login with a username/password that you previously canceled, you'll be prompted
            to REACTIVATE the account if you wish to use the site again.
          </p>
          <p>
            *Please refer to the Terms and Conditions, if necessary for details on your membership agreement.
          </p>

            <h4>SOME FUNCTIONS DON'T SEEM TO WORK?</h4>
          </li>
          <span>
            (Especially Chat and Messenger tools.) Note: Chat requires a java enabled browser with Flash player installed so some mobile devices may not work with this feature.
          </span>
          <p>
            You must have cookies enabled within your browser for some features to run properly. Cookies are a way for your browser to remember preferences when using our
            site and it can be turned on or off by using the "preferences" area of your browser (usually located in the EDIT menus, in the ADVANCED options section of both Firefox, Safari,
            Chrome or Internet Explorer).Your browser must also allow the use of javascript (which is the normal default setting on most browsers). Flash Player is also required and can be
            downloaded at www.adobe.com using the downloand menu, though most newer browsers already have Flash installed.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4> WHAT IS THE MESSENGER?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            The Messenger tool allows you to see when members who you've designated as Favorites are logged into our site. You can use the tool to message them privately.
            The Messenger tool is located at the bottom right of your screen and syncs with those names in your Favorites list. You can choose to BLOCK members from messaging you online
            by choosing the INVISIBLE preference in the Messenger tool. You can use the permanent BLOCK option on the bottom left of your browser window to manage names of users you have set to block.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>WAS EMAIL I SENT TO ANOTHER MEMBER RECEIVED?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            After sending a message to another member your SENT folder will show the message sent, and then indicate if the message is later read by the recipient or not. If you get an error message when
            sending another member an email, it means that the user's account is no longer valid or if you manually typed the username, that the username is not correct. This could also mean the person has
            canceled or their account is temporarily in suspense. If the email indicates it has not yet been read (refer to the SENT folder), you can choose to "unsend" the message anytime.
          </p>
          <h4>Tips and Your Information:</h4>
          <p>
            Email sent to another CatholicSingles.com member is meant to be sent from within the website not externally from an outside email account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do - Email members you are interested in. Do - Upload your pictures for best results. Do - Answer your essay questions and take the Compatibility Test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't - Share information you want to keep private. Don't - Ignore members. A reply is always appreciated even if just to say "No, thank you".
            Don't - Ever send a member money or other items. Use common sense and report them to us right away.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>HOW COME I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLIES FROM MY MAIL TO OTHER MEMBERS? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            Although many people reply to all their email in a timely manner, there are a few who wonder why their letters have gone unanswered. Remember, some members do NOT check their mail everyday.
            We have thousands of new members that join CatholicSingles.com each month and it is ill-advised to join for a few days and then cancel if you don't get an email answered immediately. We often
            receive letters from members who are trying to reply to an email only to find that the person who wrote them canceled a few days earlier, so please check your messages. Though it is possible to
            connect with someone quickly, finding a soulmate or good friend does take some time and patience. Relationships aren't always built overnight.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>SEND A SMILE:</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            In each profile you review there is a "Send a Smile" link...using this option will send another member your profile along with one of several images you can choose indicating your interest.
            It is a way to 'nudge' someone and let them know you are interested however it should not replace regular correspondence. We highly recommend writing in your own words to any member you are
            interested in. Remember the more interesting your first message is the better your chances are!
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>EMAIL NOTIFICATION:</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            You will always receive a reminder notice from us if there is any unread email in your Inbox. Just make sure that you go to the Contact Info section of the Account page and have this option checked off.
            (It is already checked in the "on" position as the default setting.) This checkbox is located underneath the email address you gave us during your registration and you can change it at anytime.
          </p>
            <p>NOTE: You will be sent an email reminder shortly after the email has been received into your box.</p>
          <li>
            <h4>WHAT ARE "Favorites" IN THE MEMBER SEARCHES?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            We have a feature that allows you to mark members you have viewed and elected to save into a special results page called "Favorites". By clicking on the Friends button (located on the left side of the page)
            you'll quickly bring up a list of members you have saved for quick reference. To designate a member as a favorite, you must first view their profile and then click on the "Add as Favorite" button that shows on
            their profile page. The names in your Favorites list are also synced with our Messenger tool (bottom right of your browser window).
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>I AM UNABLE TO GET INTO THE CHAT ROOMS?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            If you have trouble getting into the CHAT area, most likely your browser is not processing the Flash player request properly. Flash player is a plug-in that works with most current browsers including Chrome,
            Safari and Internet Explorer which is what we use to make our chat program work. Your browser may be outdated so regularly updating to a newer version when possible it is important. In either case, updating
            your browser and/or reinstalling your browser almost always corrects this problem. Another possibility is simply that your computer may be low on memory while you are chatting, so shutting down some other
            windows or applications you don't need while you chat may fix the problem! If you don't have Flash player installed you can CLICK HERE and download it free.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>WHAT IF SOMEONE WON'T STOP EMAILING ME? (OR OTHER ABUSES)</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            We now have a "BLOCK" button in our email area. When you get an email from someone you wish to block email from, click on the BLOCK button and that member will no longer be able to send you any email.
            The member will see a polite message stating you no longer wish to receive email from them if they try to email you again. The BLOCK button is only visible while reading a specific piece of email.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while abuses will be few and far between, please email us so that we may look into any such matter. We hope that the Holy Spirit guides each and every one of us, but there may be times when we have
            to intervene on behalf of others here in our community. Severe misuse of the site will NOT be tolerated and members may be removed as a result and without notice.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>I HAVE A PROBLEM STAYING 'LOGGED-IN' (I KEEP BEING ASKED TO LOG BACK IN)?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            If you are having this problem, most likely your browser is using a 'firewall' or 'proxy'. While our site does its best to accommodate this, sometimes it can be a problem. In this case you should try to change
            your browser preferences to bypass the proxy, and make a 'direct connection to the internet'. If you do not know how to do this, you should call your ISP for technical support and they should be able to guide
            you through this simple process.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>MY MEMBER SEARCH SHOWED TOO FEW OR TOO MANY MATCHES. THE PAGES LOAD SLOWLY OR THE RESULTS NO LONGER ADHERE TO MY SEARCH CRITERIA?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            This may be due to a slow connection, or internet traffic congestion, so please make sure the results page has fully loaded. Also, most searches will result in several pages of matches, at 5 per page.
            So please remember to use the NEXT button to continue viewing profiles. If you find that the search results no longer adhere to your search criteria after the first page of results loads, its normally
            because you are running internet security software that interferes with your browser's ability to read cookies (which are what tells each results page what your chosen criteria was), that you have changed
            your browser preferences to block cookies, or that you are behind a firewall. Please check your browser settings or internet security software settings so they allow cookies from our site, and/or check with
            your ISP or Systems Admin for help. Also, when viewing search results you may see both exact and secondary matches. Exact results will adhere to your search criteria while secondary results may offer usernames
            outside of your initial search but believed to be within your general demographic.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h4>ARE THERE OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT BESIDES CREDIT CARDS, TELECHCK or PAYPAL THAT YOU ACCEPT?</h4>
          </li>
          <p>
            Currently, no. The efficiency of credit cards and Paypal enables us to keep costs down, and more importantly offers us a way to track who is registering with us. (A good way for us to curb potential abuse and spam.)
            For those who prefer paying by check, we do accept e-checks authorized through Telecheck. All these options are available when you choose to pay.
          </p>

          <p>
            We love to get postings about events that we can share with our members. Simply use the EVENTS area in the COMMUNITY section to post details for review. We must first approve the posting for relevancy as it must be a Catholic
            event of some kind that our members might benefit from attending. (We are most interested in regional and national events and retreats.)

      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p>
        While CatholicSingles.com is available to anyone on the internet, we must ask that any and everyone registering for this service share the values of our Catholic Church and uphold those values and beliefs. Although friendships are encouraged,
        others will expect that you know if you are free to marry in the Church. If for any reason you are not sure of your status, then you should consult with a fellow Catholic or local priest. You must respect everyone using this service in a manner
        consistent with your Catholic upbringing/education and be considerate. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you! Anyone abusing their membership by using foul language either in emails or chat areas may have their memberships revoked
        without further warning. We also welcome those of you currently on your way to becoming Catholic through the sacraments of Baptism and/or Confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
